# Repository: wtbfe

## Description:
The wtbfe repository contains the code for the front-end portion of a project, which is hosted on Vercel. This project works in conjunction with the WhereToBingeFinal back-end code  and aims to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with the movie and TV show discovery platform.

## How it Works:
The front-end code is responsible for creating the user interface and facilitating the interaction between users and the back-end functionality. It utilizes various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and  framework React to render dynamic and responsive web pages.

The front-end code communicates with the back-end API to retrieve data, display information, and facilitate user actions. It handles user input, initiates requests to the back end for data retrieval or modification, and updates the user interface accordingly. It incorporates basic features like search bars, filters, sorting options, and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

## Development Process:
The development process for the front-end code involved designing the user interface, creating the necessary components and layouts, and implementing the logic for data retrieval and display. The developer might have followed front-end development best practices, including code organization, modularization, and testing to ensure the quality and functionality of the application.

## Hosting:
The front-end code is hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform for static site deployment and hosting. Vercel simplifies the deployment process by automatically building and deploying the front-end code from the repository whenever changes are made. It offers scalability, global content delivery networks (CDNs), and other performance optimizations to ensure a fast and reliable user experience.

By hosting the front-end on Vercel, the project benefits from its deployment capabilities, version control integration, and ease of use for continuous deployment and updates.

Overall, the wtbfe repository contains the front-end code that complements the WhereToBingeFinal back-end code. It enables users to interact with the movie and TV show discovery platform through an engaging and responsive user interface hosted on Vercel.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
